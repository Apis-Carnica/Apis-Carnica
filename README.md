### Stop right there! 🫵
##### I'm a special lad with a full plate!
***

📚 Currently studying for my OSCP and CISSP (ping me if you need a study partner)

📝 Procratinating lab reports makes me feel all fuzzy inside

📖 I'm writing two books, and would love to be held accountable for my inactions

💻 I'm picking up small government contracts, so reach out if you need a subcontractor for a bid

🏭 I would love to collaborate on more OT and IoT assessment tools and processes

📻 There is so much more I'd love to know about RF circuit design and embedded systems engineering

🐧 I'd love to answer your questions about testing the security of Linux systems

🌲 When I'm not messing with electronics or reading, I can be found clutching a fifth of Jameson halfway up a tree
