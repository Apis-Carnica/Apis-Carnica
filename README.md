### Howdy there!
***

It seems that you caught me in the midst of refactoring everything. Now that I have time to breathe, I'm going to make changes (and deletions) to some repos in order to streamline my projects and look slightly less like a mess. If you like some repos, please pull them soon, since they may not exist shortly. 

In other news, I'll be recoding a bunch of Python PoCs for popular CVEs after the dust is settled; if you'd like to save your forehead from gathering brick dust, make a feature request with the CVE you want converted.

Good luck on your projects, and may God have mercy on our souls.
